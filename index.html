    <h2>Recipe by: jessyratfink</h2>
    <p>
      I found the recipe was from a website named Instructables. I chose a
      garlic bread recipe since garlic bread is my favorite food, and this was
      the easiest recipe I can find. Garlic Bread is the best kind of bread that
      there is and it is a very easy food to make.

    <h2>Steps on how to make Garlic Bread:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare all the ingredients (one fresh baguette that is sliced in half
        lengthwise and then into several pieces, 4 tablespoons unsalted butter,
        1/2 teaspoon salt, two tablespoons chopped parsley, three cloves garlic
        that's minced, and 1/8 - 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese), a baking
        sheet, and set the oven to 425 Fahrenheit.
      </li>

      <li>
        Melt + Spread. Melt the butter in a small bowl and stir in the rest of
        the ingredients. Use the back of a spoon (works the best and doesn't
        ruin the bread yay!) to smooth the mixture over the bread.
      </li>

      <li>
        Bake! Bake the garlic bread at 425 F for 10-15 minutes. Keep an eye on
        it and pull it out as soon as it starts to brown around the edges,
        otherwise it'll dry out too much. Enjoy!
      </li>
